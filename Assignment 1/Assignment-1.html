    <h2>UI Design</h2>
    <P>The user interface (UI) is a critical part of any software product. When it's done well, users don't even notice it. When it's done poorly, users can't get past it to efficiently use a product. To increase the chances of success when creating user interfaces, most designers follow interface design principles. Interface design principles represent high-level concepts that are used to guide software design. In this article, I'll share a few fundamental principles. </P>
